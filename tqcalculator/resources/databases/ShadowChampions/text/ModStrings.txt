dialog01=Oh, another fan! Do you want an autograph?
dialog02=No, I'm not here to fight. I'm just chilling.
dialog03=I hope to see you around Rhodes sometime! It will be nice to meet you again.
dialog04=Take good care, and until next time buddy!
dialog05=The merchants here offer the best products you could wish for! The staff is very friendly too!
dialog06=My brother runs the tavern here. Have you checked it out yet? It offers some unique, tasty brews!
dialog07=You can also dress up at the Melinoe Sisters' shop. You can find there a wide selection of dyes! Isn't that great?
dialog08=Try not to spend all your money here, though. I know, it's so easy to get carried away! 
dialog09=This is the coolest place in town, I tell you!
dialog10=Oh, are you going there? There's no party in there. The party is happening upstairs, friend.
dialog11=It's dark, and the music isn't as loud in there. Why would you go in there?
dialog12=In all honesty, I never been in there. There must be a reason why nobody does, don't you think?
dialog13=Oh, I would join you, but I enjoy myself right now. Maybe another day?
dialog14=See you around.
dialog15=Hi there! It's been a while since we last spoke! Wait... nevermind, I've mixed you up with someone else, though you do seem very familiar. Have we met before?
dialog16=This is a nice place, isn't it? I heard it took many years to build those tunnels and open up the mall. I'm very glad they finally did; everyone was hyped about it.
dialog17=If you are the adventurous type, you can go try the public pool, though I heard the water is kind of cold. I don't like it, but maybe you will. Oh and also, those zombies are a bit smelly.
dialog18=I do like to come here once in a while and see what the shopkeepers have for sale. They often offer quite rare stuff, although they are pricing it a bit high. What do you think?
dialog19=I guess you have stuff to do now, do you? Well, it was fun talking to you. Have fun now, friend.
dialog20=YOU SMALL HUMAN, I HAVE CHALLENGE! YOU RUN TO FORGE WITH ME - THE FASTER WINS RACE! I BEST RUNNER IN HERE! YOU NO BETTER THAN ME!{^n}{^n}TIME TO RACE! YOU READY?{^n}{^n}3...{^n}2...{^n}1...{^n}GO!

dialog24=YOU BACK! READY TO ACCEPT GIFT? GIVE ME ITEM TO USE HAMMER ON!
dialog25=GOOD BYE, HUMAN! WE RACE ANOTHER DAY!
dialog26=HELLO AGAIN, HUMAN! YOU WANT TO RACE AGAIN? I WANT GOOD CHALLENGE!
dialog27=By the Gods, who are you? I must admit I wouldn't have expected the arrival of an outsider here. Tell me, how did you fought your way here? If you made it this far, maybe you would care to help the other people of the region. If you take the path up north, you should meet other survivors like us. They will surely need an helping hand!
dialog28=Take the road north, and you should find a crossroads. From there, you may go west or further north; you will meet more survivors either way. Please, do not waste any more time!
dialog29=Monsters descended so abruptly, and restlessly attacked us, so we could never move out of here. We're trapped, left with only fighting as an option.
dialog30=Please, help our neighboring friends. They need your assistance more than we do.
dialog31=Move out, I beg you!
//-
dialog32=Thank you for helping us out, stranger. We were on the edge of giving up; they have been attacking us for weeks now, and we are running out of hope. Thanks to you, we can now breathe a little bit.
dialog33=When we first arrived here, there was no monsters. It was a peaceful place, far from the bigger cities, plagues and war. It was heaven on Earth, I tell you! Now, it has merely became hell.
dialog34=Did you lost your way to get here? Maybe you should head back home. Your life is in danger, here.
dialog35=Thank you again, hero. Let us know if we can provide you anything.
//-
dialog36=Hey, you there! Have you come to help us? Please understand, those giant spiders have been around for days now, and when we get rid of them, there is always more that shows up at our doors. It must cease! The last time they came, they brought with them what seemed to be their chief, and before the battle ended, it retreated in the nearby caverns. Only a formidable hero like you has a chance to bring him down; could you do us this favor?
dialog37=We are no warriors, and we have no means to sustain this assault for much longer. Encircled, exhausted, diseased... and what next?
dialog38=Have you met any other survivors? I hope the others are safe.
dialog39=Their master is dead, finally? Oh, wonderful! What a relief it is for us. We are eternally grateful to you, hero. Take this; it is not much but it is all that we can offer in those hard times.
dialog40=We will not forget this, hero. I'll make sure to tell everyone I know of your heroic deeds.
dialog41=You are welcome here, and I love you more than a friend.
//-
dialog42=You, come over here! Can you help me? I'm sure you can, so here's the deal : our friend has lost some important scrolls and needs them back! Can you find them for us, please? I'll make sure to pay you back.
dialog43=Do I know where are they? Eh... no, I don't. I'm sure you will find them.
dialog44=I mean, I would search for them myself, if it wasn't for those cursed monsters. Only you can do it.
dialog45=Look, I promised a payment. Kindly be on your way.
dialog46=You found the scroll! Fabulous! Excellent work, stranger. This is your reward.
dialog47=Even in the darkest moments, Gods are watching over us.
//-
dialog48=I heard good news about you; thank you for helping us out despite the dire circumstances. I had prepared a reward for you, take this pristine item. May it serve you well in your future journeys.
dialog49=Thank you. I hope we meet again, in better circumstances.

Z_THQNSCRN1=Titan Quest update
Z_THQNSCRT1={&B}We are Pieces Interactive{^n}So, who are Pieces one might ask? Well, weve been around since 2007, developing games for consoles, PC and mobile. Pieces was started by a group of students from the University of Skvde in Sweden, and several of the founders are still active within the company. Weve worked on IPs such as Magicka, and Leviathan Warships.{^n}{^n}Since we became a part of the THQ Nordic family in 2017, weve been working on Titan Quest, delivering the addons Ragnark and most recently Atlantis.{^n}{^n}{&B}Titan Quest PC going forward{^n}As you might have noticed, weve been hard at work since releasing Atlantis, and have already updated it multiple times. We plan to keep supporting the already released PC-version of Titan Quest and its DLCs, with everything from general fixes and performance improvements to added features. Our priority will be based on the feedback coming from the community (thats you guys and girls!), so please report any issues on our public bug-tracker https://redmine.thqnordic.com/projects/titan-quest-atlantis-community{^n}{^n}{&B}Titan Quest console{^n}From here on out, we will start digging into the console versions of Titan Quest. Starting out with whats already been released and improve upon it, and eventually moving on with Ragnark and Atlantis. Since were a small team, bear with us since it might take some time before were up and running and updates start coming out.{^n}{^n}Its been a privilege to work on such a classic game, and we look forward to keep supporting it. Huge thanks to everyone in the community for all the feedback and bug reports coming in, it really does help us in the process of making the game even better! Well make sure to keep you updated on the journey we have ahead of us!
Z_THQNSCRN2=Titan Quest: The future
Z_THQNSCRT2=Hello everyone!{^n}Here is an update on what is in the works for Titan Quest. None of these are set in stone and are subject to change as required by development and your feedback.{^n}{^n}{&B}Gamepad support{^n}We now have gamepad support in our development version of the game. This first version is focused on when you play sitting by your monitor. It keeps most of the same user interface as when playing with mouse and keyboard to make it easy to switch between them. As a next step, we will look into integrating the console UI and HUD code. We are still early but just wanted to give an update that its finally getting some traction{^n}{^n}{&B}Launcher{^n}We have merged the Legacy and Enhanced edition into a single executable file. This will make it possible to have a single Titan Quest icon on the desktop. When you start the game you will get a launcher window that lets you select what version to play and also display some useful links.{^n}{^n}{&B}Modding{^n}We are working on improving the mod support in Titan Quest. This includes better documentation on how to create mods, updating the mod tools and getting the game to handle more than one mod at a time. One requested feature that will be released soon is the ability for mods to add new languages to replace all the text in the game.{^n}{^n}Besides the things above we are also working on improving the performance and fixing bugs reported to us in Redmine. To chat with us, go ahead and join the Titan Quest discord https://discord.gg/RX8KakD, where youll find some of the developers. We might be a bit unresponsive at times as we are working on the game. For bugs, the best way is to report any issues to Redmine https://redmine.thqnordic.com/projects/titan-quest-atlantis-community{^n}{^n}Due to the fact we are covering so many different subjects with this blog post, we are gonna have another one coming up soon that will cover the progress we are working on with the console version of Titan Quest!
Z_THQNSCRN3=The future of Titan Quest on consoles
Z_THQNSCRT3=Here is an update on what we are doing on the console version of Titan Quest.{^n}{^n}{&B}Playing on Console{^n}{^n}To get the team started on development, they spent a day playing the game on console. Everyone played on Switch except one of the developers that went for the Playstation 4 version. The most popular Mastery was Storm followed by Warfare and then Spirit, Rogue, and Earth. We played single-player only this time and none was fast enough to get to Act Two in one day. It was a good lesson, and it gave us an idea of how the game works on console compared to the PC version that we have more experience with. {^n}{^n}{&B}The Plan{^n}Our goal for Titan Quest on the console is to fix bugs, increase the performance and release both DLCs Ragnark and Atlantis. The early focus will be on the quality and the stability of the game. Numerous stability changes have been done on Titan Quest for PC and will be now be moved over to the console version. After that, we will play split-screen and multiplayer to get a multiplayer experience as stable as possible. {^n}{^n}You can help us by using our Redmine for Titan Quest Console to report bugs and feedback. We will keep an eye on the larger player communities for feedback and bugs but Redmine is the best way to make sure we do not miss anything. Check it out here: https://redmine.thqnordic.com/projects/titan-quest-console.{^n}{^n}{&B}Extra little notice{^n}We expect to launch a patch for PC during this week, tho no full estimate yet.
Z_THQNSCRN4=Titan Quest  August 2019 Progress Update
Z_THQNSCRT4=Greetings Titan Slayers!!{^n}Summer is over and the office is once again filled with recharged and rested developers! Here is a small update on whats going on.{^n}{^n}{&B}Consoles{^n}The focus from here on out will be on integrating the Ragnark and Atlantis expansions into the PS4, Xbox and Switch versions. We will also merge bug fixes and performance enhancements we have made previously in the PC version into the console versions. Once all expansions are up and running, well look into further optimizations and fixes.{^n}We will provide more updates on our progress as this work gets further underway.{^n}{^n}{&B}PC{^n}We have made an update to some of the online systems. For the players this will mostly consists of a refresh button in the server browser, but under the hood it comes with tweaks and fixes that should provide for a smoother playing experience. This is currently being tested and will be released in an upcoming patch.{^n}As mentioned earlier we are integrating gamepad support in the PC version. We are continuing this and are currently evaluating where to go with it.
Z_THQNSCRN5=Titan Quest  September 2019 Progress Update
Z_THQNSCRT5=Here is an update on what is going on in the world of Titan Quest.{^n}{^n}{&B}Consoles{^n}The work of integrating Atlantis and Ragnark into the console version is well under way. Currently we have moved from the integration phase into a fix and optimize phase.{^n}There are some performance related challenges. Atlantis contains some of the most demanding areas in the game and we strive to provide a smooth user experience on all platforms. Especially the Switch will require some work to ensure that.{^n}{^n}{&B}Pc{^n}We are also working on gamepad support for the PC version which was one of the most requested features for years. We have decided to implement most of the UI from the console version and switch between that and the normal UI when input is detected on either mouse/keyboard or gamepad. This is definitely the hard mode of this task but we are doing that because we believe it will provide the best user experience for the growing number of gamepad users on PC. It will require some serious adaptations in the background but in the end we think it will be an awesome experience. We are currently in the middle of integrating this and will provide further updates moving forward.{^n}We are also going to include the Titan Quest OST in MP3 format when patch 2.9 goes live as this is something we have seen our community request quite a few times. This patch will soon hit the beta and then move onto the live version as soon as we are sure that there are no bugs.
Z_THQNSCRN6=Titan Quest  October 2019 Progress Update
Z_THQNSCRT6=Greetings and welcome to another chapter of the Titan Quest development blog!{^n}{^n}{&B}Consoles{^n}We are working hard to take the expansions to the consoles. As we explained in last months blog post there are some performance challenges. The Atlantis expansion was created with a modern PC as target platform. We implemented a new deferred DX11 renderer to take advantage of new technology and support environments that were richer and more detailed than in earlier parts of the game. When we brought this content to the console version some platforms (Switch in particular) had issues keeping up. This was not unexpected but all the same troubling. On our quest to chase down milliseconds we are looking at many different options including but not limited to rendering, shadows, reflections and content scaling. We are working hard to make sure the players will get the best possible experience.{^n}{^n}{&B}PC{^n}For the PC version the Gamepad UI is getting closer to a testable product. As we wrote in the previous blog it is a big chunk of work that is going into this. We have heard that the interest from the community is very high and that is inspiring to hear. We are listening and will do our best to deliver the feature you deserve!{^n}There will be a 2.9 patch released very soon. It is currently in beta and will contain some updates to matchmaking and multiplayer. We are just finalizing the multiplayer backend changes. For players this makes little difference but should result in a smoother overall experience when playing multiplayer.
Z_THQNSCRN7=Titan Quest November Update
Z_THQNSCRT7=Time for a new update on whats going on in the world of Titan Quest!{^n}{^n}{&B}Consoles{^n}The integration of Atlantis and Ragnark into the console version is continuing. We are currently in a quality assurance and optimization phase, making sure that we iron out issues before release. We have made improvements and fixes to all parts of the game including the base game so there will be a patch for the game even if you dont get the expansions.{^n}As discussed in earlier posts, we are working hard to optimize the Atlantis content for the console version since this is the most demanding part of the game. We are making good progress and are pushing hard to deliver a smooth experience.{^n}{^n}{&B}PC{^n}The implementation of gamepad support in the PC version is now in a state where we will start testing it externally very soon. It is still a bit early to say when this will be rolled out as we are expecting some areas where we need to go in and tune things but we are definitely getting closer. We will leave you with a screenshot of the gamepad player HUD. This has been done with the PC version:
Z_THQNSCRN8=Titan Quest February Update
Z_THQNSCRT8=Hello Questers! It has been a while since you last heard from us, sorry about that. We have been hard at work hence the lack of updates.{^n}{^n}{&B}Consoles{^n}The console version is going through the quality assurance process. We have detected some stability issues in the game which we want to get to the bottom of before release. It has taken longer than expected since some of the issues are a bit complex and time consuming to debug. Some are bug fixes for the base game, which will benefit everyone even if you are not going to get the DLCs. We have chosen to do this because we want to make sure we get the game into the condition that it deserves.{^n}When we are done with this step we will submit the patch and the DLCs for platform certification, which is the final step before we can release them. We are working hard to get them into your hands and it is not far away now.{^n}{^n}{&B}PC{^n}Now onto something that should make you gamepad lovers happy! The gamepad support implementation has passed internal QA, and we are glad to announce that the next step is to get your feedback on how it works. We will do this in the form of a public beta that will start shortly. Check back here or on our discord (discord.gg/titanquest) if you are interested in participating!
