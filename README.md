# TitanQuestCalculator
A Titan Quest calculator for all masteries, including modded ones as long as they are supported.

I love Titan Quest, especially the awesome modding community around it.
There are some pretty nice mods with whole mastery overhauls out there but I really like to pre-build my class and spec out the masteries and skills to see where I end up and at which level.
So I decided to make my own calculator with support for any mod you can throw at it (as long as it works in-game...hopefully :D)
